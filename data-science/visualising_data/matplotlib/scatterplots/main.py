    The matplotlib Gallery will give you a good idea of the sorts of
    things you can do with matplotlib (and how to do them).
    seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and allows you to easily
    produce prettier (and more complex) visualizations.
    Altair is a newer Python library for creating declarative
    visualizations.
    D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing sophisticated interactive
    visualizations for the web. Although it is not in Python, it is widely
    used, and it is well worth your while to be familiar with it.
    Bokeh is a library that brings D3-style visualizations into Python.
